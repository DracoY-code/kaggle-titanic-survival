# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is based on the [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) competition hosted on Kaggle. The repository contains notebooks, models, and documentation for the project. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization steps to build a predictive model. The objective of the competition is to predict if a passenger is able to survive the sinking of the Titanic based on the features defined in the Titanic dataset.

## Personal Goals

Through this project, my goal is to learn certain aspects of Machine Learning projects and prepare a standard workflow for future projects and implementations. Thus, this project follows a standard workflow which can be summarised as follows:

- Downloading and loading the Titanic dataset into the Jupyter notebook.
- Exploring and visualising the dataset with custom plotting functions.
- Preprocessing the dataset with Scikit-Learn imputers and transformers.
- Training different models on the preprocessed dataset.
- Evaluating and comparing the performance of the trained models.
- Selecting the best model and making final predictions.
- Submitting the final predictions and saving the best model.
